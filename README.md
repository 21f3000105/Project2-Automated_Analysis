# Autolysis - Automated Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
**Autolysis** is a Python-based script designed to automate data analysis, visualization, and reporting for CSV datasets. It generates insights, charts, and a descriptive narrative using a large language model (LLM). The script is especially useful for quickly analyzing datasets and generating comprehensive reports.

   - Summarizes the dataset (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
   - Identifies missing values and correlations.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Generates histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps for numeric columns.
   - Creates bar plots for the most frequent values in categorical columns.
   - Saves all visualizations in a directory based on the CSV filename.

3. **Narrative Generation**:
   - Utilizes an LLM to provide a textual analysis of the dataset.

4. **Comprehensive Reporting**:
   - Creates a Markdown-based report (`README.md`) summarizing the dataset and visualizations.
